Stock market forecasting and analysis are among the most difficult tasks. There are several reasons for this, including market volatility and a variety of other dependent and independent variables that influence the market value of a specific stock. These variables make it extremely difficult for any stock market expert to predict the market's rise and fall with great precision. However, with the advent of Machine Learning and its powerful algorithms, recent market research and Stock Market Prediction advancements have begun to incorporate such approaches in analyzing stock market data. To summarize, many organizations use Machine Learning Algorithms to predict the stock market. This article will walk you through a basic analysis and forecasting implementation. Since forecast prediction will be a regression problem to predict the future stock trend based on past data, we will use models such as Random Forest Regressor, Support Vector Regressor, Artificial Neural Networks (ANN), and Long-short term memory ANN.
